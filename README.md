I basically have written my own bot in 24h based on my previous tibia ots bot.

- monster nick AI Image recognition
- circles with cursor around moving monster until found 'sword' icon to attack and click
- checking hp percentage (based on % of pixels in bar in the hp/mana window)
- auto item pickup (just spam button, but removed that, pet is more worthy)
- multithreading, of course zero blocking and independent system to check if currently in battle/if should heal/if should attack etc


Whole thing based no cv image recognition, if you want to exp on mushpang you have to do some screenshots of mushpang basically.

If any one intersted pm me, can share probably for something or not (:

QUESTION: If i do not do captcha, will my character be banned? or what
